# Setting Up Your Project and Version Control (Git)

This section will guide you through creating a Git repository from existing work and setting up the remote repository.

## Step 1: Create Your R Studio Project and QMD File

1.  Open R Studio.

2.  Create a new project.

    ::: callout-note
    ### How to create new project?

    Go to **File \> New Project \> New Directory \> New Project** to get started.

    Enter the project's name and browse the location where you want to store your project, and click create project .
    :::

3.  Create a new .qmd file.

    ::: callout-note
    ### How to create new .qmd file?

    Go to **File \> New File \> Quarto Document**

    Enter the title and author's name. You can also choose the output (e.g. HTML or PDF or Word).
    :::

4.  The section at the top of your `.qmd` file (between`---`) is the YAML header. Here, you can change the title, subtitle, author name, output format (e.g., PDF or HTML), and theme.

5.  Don't forget to save your file and rename it.

::: callout-caution
This setup only creates a new project **without version control**. It simply creates a new project folder in your chosen location.

## Step 2: Initialise The Git Repository

1.  Open your terminal in R Studio
2.  Make sure it has the correct path. If not, use `cd` command to change the directory

``` bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

3.  If you are in the correct directory, initialise the new Git repository using this command in your terminal:

``` bash
git init
```
